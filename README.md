A notion of creating smart cities with integrated high end ICT technologies, including cloud, edge, IoTs, and so forth, has increased recently in order to provide a reasonably high comfort to city residents with limited human intervention.
In fact, one of the major challenges faced by city authorities of developing countries is to control air pollution, which might
cause chronic diseases and financial concerns to the residents. Although a few air quality monitoring and air pollution control
measures exist, these solutions are not remaining as assets to cities. In this work, a revenue oriented, cloud microservice based air quality prediction framework is implemented for smart cities.
